# diversity-tracker

This app visualises the race and gender diversity at my work. It shows information on our current staff demographic, how this has changed over time and how it compares to the demographic of the applications we recieve for roles. There is also the possibility for a user to enter the information of their company and compare it to the demographic of london.
