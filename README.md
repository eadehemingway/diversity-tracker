# information on data
The data I have used on the demographic of london have come mostly from the 2011 UK census. 
I struggled to find a figure for how many non binary people live in london so I have estimated it based on information found on this site: https://practicalandrogyny.com/2014/12/16/how-many-people-in-the-uk-are-nonbinary/

I am currently dividing diversity categories fairly crudely, (e.g. Gender and Race) which doesnt account for intersectionality. I intend to develop the app further in the future to address this. 

I welcome feedback and ideas on how I could improve the app.
